LRU:

Made use of an array to keep track of which index was recently used. If a page fault occurs, the mininum value among the count array will check which index has been least recently used. Each iteration will be displayed with an indication of "H" if it is a hit or "F" if a page fault occurs.

LFU:

Made use of an array to store the frequency count of each index in the frames. The index with least amount of frequency will be replaced when a page fault occurs. Each iteration will be displayed with an indication of "H" if it is a hit or "F" if a page fault occurs.
